This is a collection of classes and functions that aid in the computation of 
(disconnected) stationary descendent integrals to a target elliptic curve. It was used 
to generate the results in the following preprint:

Stationary Descendents and the Discriminant Modular Form  \n
https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14198

The classes and functions are written in Sage/Python, so the user will need an installation of 
Sage in order to run the code locally. Once this is done, one can either copy and paste the code
in the .txt file to work with the code, or run the accompanying Jupyter Notebook (I'd reccomend 
the latter choice, since it will also provivde the mathematical explanation/motivation of the code).
